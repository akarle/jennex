Our Wedding Site

Not much to see here yet (it's a work in progress!).

I'm putting this together for our wedding (:tada:) in 2023 after a
quick survey of the common choices for hosted sites (The Knot, Minted,
etc).

The goals are to have:

1. A public wedding portfolio / information site for guests (mostly
   done, just static HTML)
2. A lightweight RSVP system (likely the more interesting bit from a
   code perspective)
