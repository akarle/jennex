    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Alex and Jennie met in January 2017 at UMass Amherst through a
      mutual friend (thanks Rachana!) at a party, but they weren't sure
      if they'd see each other again. Fortunately, Rachana saw the
      potential and insisted on a group date later that week. Phone
      numbers were exchanged and just a day or so later they went on
      their first date in a snowstorm at the Frank dining commons. The
      rest is history!

      After graduation they moved to Natick, MA, and as soon as a
      landlord allowed it they adopted two kittens, Pulp and Meeks.
      5 years, 4 jobs, 2 appartments, and 1 pandemic later, they're
      still there, supporting each other.

      After many trips together that left the family guessing if "he'd
      finally ask the question", Alex proposed to Jennie on August 20,
      2022 on top of Franconia Ridge in the White Mountains. It was the
      exact spot they had hoped to be 4 years ago on a trip that they
      ended short due to bears, a heat wave, and blisters. Back years
      later and stronger than ever, she said yes!
